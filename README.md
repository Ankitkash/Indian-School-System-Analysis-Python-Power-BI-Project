# ðŸ“Š Indian School System Analysis â€“ Python + Power BI Project

This project analyzes the Indian School System dataset using both Python and Power BI.
The goal is to explore how schools are distributed across states, districts, villages, and management types, and present the insights through interactive visualizations.

## ðŸ“Š Insights from the Analysis

- **State-wise School Categories**: Top states with the highest number of schools
- **District-wise School Categories**: Districts with maximum category count
- **Village-level School Distribution**: Most prominent villages in terms of school count
- **Urban vs Rural Distribution**: How schools are spread across rural and urban areas
- **Management Type**: Government vs Private vs National board managed schools
